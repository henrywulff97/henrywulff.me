  "This website was written as a private project and exercise for myself. I used React Typescript, with SASS for styling.\nI tried to use as few templates as possible to make it not too easy on me.\nHowever I did use the frontend framework 'Foundation'. But I didn't use any templates or similar for this.\nThe code is open source and can be viewed with the link below.", //5
